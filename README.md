# Cool Todo List Web App
>A cool and elegant to-do list web app created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The users are able to add, complete, and delete tasks interactively. The app also has a confetti effect upon completing tasks to increase productivity. The project showcases my front-end development, DOM manipulation, user experience, and creativity skills.
